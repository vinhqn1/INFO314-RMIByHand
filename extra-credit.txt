Add object instances. (3 pts) Instead of static methods (Java) or top-level functions (Python), 
add the ability to call object-instance methods. This means that clients must somehow either 
remotely "new" an object on the Server, and both the Server and the Client must have some way 
of identifying a Server-hosted object to the Client that the Client can use to identify which 
object on the Server to invoke. 
HINT: This is probably not a fair assignment to give to college students--consider it more of a 
thought exercise than a "you must submit code". Think about how would you do it, and submit a few 
paragraphs of prose or pseudocode that explains your idea.

To implement this, I would think that there needs to be a way for the Server to identify remote
objects. I believe this is done through extending the Remote interface. The server needs to have
a list of remote objects which is shared with the client. The list should have the references to 
the remote objects so that the client can have references these remote objects. The client would
do a RMI to get this registry and get the reference. With the reference, the client could then
RMI on the object reference.
